<?php echo ave();?> began life as a <a href='/versions/python'>Python game</a>. At <a href='https://emfcamp.org' target='new'>EMF Camp 2016</a>
we made a version of <?php echo ave();?> that runs on the <a href='https://badge.emfcamp.org/wiki/TiLDA_MK3' target='new'>TiLDA Mk&pi;</a> badge
that was given to every attendee. Shortly after EMF Camp, we began work on a javascript version of <?php echo ave();?>, this website and 
Android and iOs apps (coming soon).
<br /><br />
You can now use this javascript version to play <?php echo ave();?> games online <a href='/play'>here</a>. The playable games include user
contibuted games.
<br /><br />
If you would like to write your own games for <?php echo ave();?>, have a look at
<a href='/make'>these instructions</a>. Once you have written a game, you can submit it to the game library <a href='/add'>here</a>.
You can view all user submitted games <a href='/library'>in the library</a>. Once a game has been included in the game library, it will become
playable on any version of <?php echo ave();?> (as long as the player is connected to the internet).
