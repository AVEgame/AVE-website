# [A]DVENTURE! [V]ILLAINY! [E]XCITEMENT!

AVE: Adventure! Villainy! Excitement! is a text-based game engine
written by Matthew Scroggs.

This repository is for its website. To build the website, build the javascript version of the 
[AVE repository](http://github.com/mscroggs/AVE) and place it in the /ave folder of this repository.

You can find the AVE repository at [github.com/mscroggs/AVE](http://github.com/mscroggs/AVE).


Some useful pages on the website
--------------------------------
* JSON list of games: http://avegame.co.uk/gamelist.json
* `.ave` of a default game: http://avegame.co.uk/download/NAME.ave
* `.ave` of a user game: http://avegame.co.uk/download/user/NAME.ave
* JSON of a default game: http://avegame.co.uk/download/NAME.json
* JSON of a user game: http://avegame.co.uk/download/user/NAME.json

NAMEs are the keys from `gamelist.json`, although the keys include
`.ave`, so replace `.ave` with `.json` if you want a JSON.
