As well as a game engine, <?php echo ave();?> is also a simple language that allows
you to write your own games.
<br /><br />
Before making your own games, you should download the Python version of <?php echo ave();?>.
This will allow you to run your game to test it.
The easiest way to do this is to
<a href='https://github.com/AVEgame/AVE/releases/download/v1.3/AVE1.3-python.zip' target='new'>download the .zip of the latest version</a>.
<br /><br />
Once you have downloaded the Python version of <?php echo ave();?>, you are ready to write your own game.
To help you with this, you can use the following documentation:
<ul>
<li><a href='/docs/guide.md'>How to make your own game</a></li>
</ul>

Once you have made a game, you can submit it to the game library <a href='/add'>here</a>. You game will need to be manually approved before
it is added. Please be patient.
